# Disconnectme-pihole
Disconnectme JSON files converted to Pi-Hole compatible blocklists.

# Usage

***DISCLAIMER**: Both entities.txt and services.txt seem to contain large amount of false positives. Use with caution.*

There are generally 2 files in this repository:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erkexzcx/disconnectme-pihole/master/entities.txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erkexzcx/disconnectme-pihole/master/services.txt
```

If you want to customize **services.txt** file, use below blocklists instead (*it's literally the same services.txt file, but splitted into categories*):
```
